				For over 50 years, the Phildelphia Eagles sported one of the all time great uniforms in NFL history, featuring the classic Kelly Green color scheme.  In 1996, new owner Jeffery Lurie decided that he wanted to put his own mark on the franchise, and changed the primary color to Midnight Green.  We think that this was a huge blunder, and are committed to doing everything possible to Bring Back the Kelly Green!
				<br><br>
				We need volunteers to help with the following:
				<ul class='volunteers'>
					<li>
						Spread awareness of our cause throughout the Greater Philadelphia Area.

					<li>
						Make ownership and management aware of the desire of fans for this change.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Participate in rallies and demonstrations at team offices and home games.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
